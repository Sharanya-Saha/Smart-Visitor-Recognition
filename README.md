# Smart-Visitor-Recognition

- The main aim of the project is to create a smart visitor recognition system which notifies the owner with the help of internet, whenever a person is at the door.
- Whenever a person is on the door the camera sensor is triggered and an image is clicked which is matched with the dataset and accordingly actions are take.
- The project facilitates rule based desicion making on the recognised image.
